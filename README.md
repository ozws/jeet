# Jeet

Based on [Jeet](http://jeet.gs), an is the most advanced, yet intuitive, grid system on the market today.

By making use of the power of pre-processors, we can now pass real fractions (or float numbers) as context that generates a percentage based width and gutter for grids. We're able to do this while maintaining a consistently sized infinitely nestable gutter.

Check out [this presentation](http://corysimmons.github.io/presentations/the-rise-of-ratio-grids) to learn more about what sets Jeet above other grid systems.

This Oz version of Jeet is designed for use in:

- [SCSS](scss)

#### Browser Support
- IE9+ and all major browsers without polyfills like Selectivizr
- It has been reported that IE7 + 8 can be supported, but please **use at your own risk**. You will need [Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/) along with [a required library](http://selectivizr.com/#how). You may also want [Html5 Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) & [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond).
